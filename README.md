This section presents an overview of the project requirements and constraints. Specific details are
discussed later.The Real-time Chess Game
In this part, the users should be able to play a two-player real-time chess game. 
The final target for
each player is to win the chess game. The game is a popular Android game titled "Chezz: Play Fast
Chess". In this project,Each player can move his pieces to win
the game. The goal is to kill your opponent's king.
The game is like any standard chess, each piece moves exactly like standard chess. The main
difference is that there are no turns, which means one player can move multiple pieces while the other
player didn't move any pieces. There is a countdown for each piece to be moved again, for example, if
I moved the queen now, I can't move the same queen again for 2 seconds although I can move any
other piece at this time.It is required to connect 2 PCs through a Simple network, using serial communication. Two functions are to be implemented: chatting, and a two-player real-time chess game.

 <h2 align='center'>☑️ Structure & How to Run ☑️ </h2>
<div align='center'>
 </div>
   <p> <h4> Inside Modular Code you should find: </h4>
   🔵 <b>macros.inc</b> which has all the Macros that we've used (X86-Macro Library).
  <br> 🟡 <b>Graphics.inc</b> which includes all the graphics (assets) used in the game.
  <br> 🔴 <b>Game.asm</b> which is the game itself, it uses all two other files.
  <br>
  If you're using DOSBOX through VSCODE then simply copy the content of this folder to the extensions workspace (as in the .txt) and that should then run by default, otherwise   you might just use the normal incantation of masm-ing each file then linking all. Regardless, you need a virtual port simulator for this (to simulate playing/chatting on two different computers)
